# Catalogue of verse

cataloguing the verse of J. R. R. Tolkien eventually with metrical and rhyme information

Preliminary information on The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings is available in:

* hobbit.tsv
* lotr.tsv

Note the latter was extracted completely automatically from the TEI XML text and so likely has issues which need to be fixed (or clarified) upstream.

Next steps include:

* addressing the above issue
* adding more precise references (e.g. LRC for LOTR)
* adding more information on who is speaking/singing the verse
* establishing best format for rhyme and metre analysis (e.g. see TEI)
* analysis of rhyme
* analysis of metre
* extend corpus to other Middle-earth poetry
* extend corpus to other Tolkien poetry
